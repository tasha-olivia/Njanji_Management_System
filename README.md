Detailed definition of users and explanation of Functionalities
Admin: An admin is a member of the njangi group that has been allowed to control the system. The 
admin portal is one and can be accessed by anyone who has been chosen by the group to have 
access to the system. It is recommended that at most two of them should exist for a group. The main 
Admin and his assistant where the assistant work only in the absence of the main Admin. This means 
the system will have just one admin account.
Functions of the Admin:
- Initiates the registration procedure for each member: The admin will issue a special code to anyone 
who has to begin registration and tie it with the name of the person. It is only after this that the user 
can begin other registration procedures.
-Receive info concerning troubles and celebration
-Authenticate Fund transfer from the njangi’s account to any other account
-Authorizes Borrowing (upon presentation of suretee)
-Assign social contribution amount
-Produce receipts for every transactions
Regular Users: These are users of the system who will regularly drop in monthly contributions and 
participate during all social contributions and are ready for the penalties of failing to contribute. An 
admin is also a user.
Function of the Users:
-Contribute Monthly
-Participate in all social contributions
-Benefit from the Njangi through social contribution of others or during ones turn of “picking”
-Act as shortee: A shortee is a member of the group who is willing to stand by someone who is 
borrowing and meets the necessary conditions for borrowing as seen in the borrowing procedure.
Functions:
1) Registration: An account is pre-created for the admin and he can only change the password.
For the regular users, the admin initiates the registration procedure by giving a special code 
to the user who will now use his name and that code to continue his registration procedures. 
The admin only does this if the user has a banking account which could be either mobile 
money, orange money or any international bank account. Other information during 
registration are addresses, contacts, name, demographic info and account details. Then a
password to secure the account.
2) Fund Transfer: The admin initiates all fund transfers by selecting the beneficiary account 
info confirming the amount and sends. He also authenticates the monthly “picking” since 
the selection is rather based on a random algorithm than a known order. Lastly when 
borrowing is confirmed, the admin authenticates the transfer of funds to the borrower. 
Records are kept for every fund Transfer.
3) Fund Reception: Both monthly and during social contributions, users are expected to send 
money to the njangi account. The system keeps tract of who has sent, how much has been 
sent and why it was sent. After a dateline which is generally agreed by the group and 
implemented by the admin in the system, anyone who hasn’t paid has automatically 
completed a borrow from the system. The njangi group could also receive donations for 
outsiders or even members just for support.
4) Borrowing: Before a member borrows, he has to present a shortee to the system and 
present his account balance(or pay slip). The shortee must accept the shortee request by 
sending his account balance information. The system will then check is the sum of money in 
the shortees account and the borrower is up to 75% of the money to be borrowed. If This 
condition is met, the a borrow request is sent the admin for authentication.
